This Employee Management System is a simple web-based application designed to perform basic CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete—on employee records. It allows administrators to add new employees, view a list of all employees, edit existing employee details, and remove employees from the system. The backend is built using Python (Flask), while the frontend is developed using HTML and CSS. All employee data is stored locally, making the system ideal for small businesses or educational projects. It's a practical way to learn web development and data management fundamentals.
